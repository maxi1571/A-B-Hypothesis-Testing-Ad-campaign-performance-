 The Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO) data for this project is a “Yes” and “No” response of online users.
 The data has 9 columns and 8077 rows.
 
 Data exploration and implementation of the conventional p-value based algorithm and the sequential A/B testing algorithm in Python are included in the notebooks in this repository. 

The data collected for this challenge has the following columns auction_id: the unique id of the online user who has been presented the BIO. In standard terminologies this is called an impression id. The user may see the BIO questionnaire but choose not to respond.
